Spring Boot:

Application Runner:
Application Runner is an interface used to execute the code after the Spring Boot application started. 
The example given below shows how to implement the Application Runner interface on the main class file

Example:
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication implements ApplicationRunner {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
   }
   @Override
   public void run(ApplicationArguments arg0) throws Exception {
      System.out.println("Hello World from Application Runner");
   }
}


Interceptor  :

You can use the Interceptor in Spring Boot to perform operations under the following situations −

Before sending the request to the controller

Before sending the response to the client

preHandle() method − This is used to perform operations before sending the request to the controller. This method should return true to return the response to the client.

postHandle() method − This is used to perform operations before sending the response to the client.

afterCompletion() method − This is used to perform operations after completing the request and response.


@Component
public class ProductServiceInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {
   @Override
   public boolean preHandle(
      HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception {
      
      return true;
   }
   @Override
   public void postHandle(
      HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, 
      ModelAndView modelAndView) throws Exception {}
   
   @Override
   public void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, 
      Object handler, Exception exception) throws Exception {}
}


@Component
public class ProductServiceInterceptorAppConfig extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter {
   @Autowired
   ProductServiceInterceptor productServiceInterceptor;

   @Override
   public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
      registry.addInterceptor(productServiceInterceptor);
   }
}
