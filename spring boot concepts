@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication implements ApplicationRunner {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
   }
   @Override
   public void run(ApplicationArguments arg0) throws Exception {
      System.out.println("Hello World from Application Runner");
   }
}
