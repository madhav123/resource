Aggregate:

Aggregate is a pattern in Domain-Driven Design. 
A DDD aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. 
An example may be an order and its line-items, these will be separate objects, 
but it's useful to treat the order (together with its line items) as a single aggregate.
